SDK Sample for iOS
==================

The screenshot for this sample is displayed below. Please read [here](../README.md) the explanation about this and other samples in the SDK.
Anyway, please be aware that all samples reference the [_shared folder](../_shared) during compilation and therefore it is recommended that you download [all samples](../), instead of only this one, in order to succeed when compiling any sample.
